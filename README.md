# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-CNN-Data-Augmentation-and-Batch-Normalization

This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It explores various techniques to improve model performance, including data augmentation and batch normalization.

## Features

- **Data Augmentation:** Implements image transformations (rotation, shift, flip) to improve model generalization.
- **Batch Normalization:** Applies normalization to activations in the CNN layers to speed up training and improve performance.
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset:** A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compares the performance of models with and without batch normalization and data augmentation.
